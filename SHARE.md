**Title:** poly16z - Open-source AI framework for building Polymarket trading bots

**Body:**
```
I just open-sourced poly16z, a framework for building AI-powered Polymarket trading bots.

**The key insight:** Instead of coding complex trading logic, you just describe your strategy in natural language, and Claude AI handles the decision-making.

**Example:**
```python
STRATEGY = """
You are a momentum trader. Look for markets where:
- Price moved >10% in the last hour
- Volume is above average
- Good liquidity

Trade in the direction of momentum.
Exit at +25% profit or -15% loss.
"""

agent = AnthropicAgent(strategy_prompt=STRATEGY)
await agent.run()
```

**What's included:**
- Complete Polymarket API integration
- AI agent framework (observe-decide-act loop)
- Risk management (position sizing, stop-loss, limits)
- News & social data collectors
- Backtesting engine
- 3 working example bots

**Use cases:**
- Test prediction market strategies
- Automate Polymarket trading
- Learn AI agent development
- Research market inefficiencies

Everything is modular - use the whole framework or just the parts you need.

**Title:** poly16z – AI framework for Polymarket trading bots

**URL:** https://github.com/randomness11/poly16z

**Optional comment:**
```
Author here. I built this to make it dead simple to create AI trading bots
for Polymarket.

The core idea: define your trading strategy in natural language, and Claude
analyzes markets and makes decisions based on your prompt.

Key features:
- Natural language strategy prompts (no complex coding)
- Built-in risk management
- Backtesting before live trading
- Complete Polymarket integration

It's fully modular - you can use individual components (API client, risk
manager, backtesting) or the complete AI agent framework.

Includes 3 working examples: momentum bot, contrarian bot, and news-driven bot.

Happy to answer questions!
